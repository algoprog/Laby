Laby is a maze editor, generator &amp; solver written in Java. It can solve mazes with the following search algorithms: DFS, BFS, ID, Best-First, Hill Climbing and A*. Also, using a variation of DFS algorithm, it can generate two types of mazes, randomized and classic. The generated mazes can be easily edited and saved as plain text files.

# Features
- generates 2 types of mazes
- dynamic maze editor
- 6 algorithms for maze solving
- 2 heuristic functions
- step by step execution
- option for choosing cells randomly
- option to draw arrows from predecessors

# Instructions
There are two versions available; the full version with GUI, and one without GUI implemented so that you can use it for your own applications. There is also one precompiled jar.
