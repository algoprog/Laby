# Laby
Laby is a maze editor, generator &amp; solver written in Java. It can solve mazes with the following search algorithms: DFS, BFS, ID, Best-First, Hill Climbing and A*. Also, using a variation of DFS algorithm, it can generate two types of mazes, randomized and classic. The generated mazes can be easily edited and saved as plain text files.
